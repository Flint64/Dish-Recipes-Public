# Dish Recipes

This project was started several years ago from an offhanded comment from a friend about having to scroll through people's life stories just to get to the recipe.
So, I built a prototype. It wasn't pretty, and it didn't play nice on different browsers, but it worked. 

A couple years later, I'm now a senior studying web development, and it's time for my senior practicum. So I decide to resurrect the old Dish Recipes site, and build
it anew with Angular. The project gets completed, and shelved away under "things to get to later."

Fast forward another year or so, and I get to poking around in my old senior project directory, and realize, there's a lot of stuff in here that I like. But a a lot
that could be handled better. So now, this is the third, (though likely not the final) iteration of Dish Recipes, rebuilt with Angular for the second time,
hosted, and ready for use.
